 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.d:0 "Docked at Port Festiva, the naval transport ship USS Golden was offloading a new shipment of supplies bound for central Mewni. As the mewman dock workers scurried about, two Californians stood at the side of the ship near the bridge, looking down below where the wooden docks met the metal hull. Lady Everette, a former US Senator before the collapse of the US and now holding the title of Lady as she served as Norton’s Secretary of Treasury, smirked, ‘Look at them. Uneducated peasants.’\n\n‘An unfair assessment, Lady Everette,’ said recently titled Lord Birnbaum, the CEO of Northwest of California, ‘That is why we are here. To bring them our help and assistance.’\n\n‘We are here, Birnbaum, only as traders because of the infinite grace of the Emperor!’\n\n‘That and because both the State Assembly and the people support our help to the mewmans,’ Birnbaum pointed out.\n\n‘The ‘Mewmans’ are a backward people. They have ‘magic’ and ‘interdimensional travel’, yet they still use hand cranked cranes and horse drawn carriages. They live in squalor, unlike us Californians!’\n\n‘Norton only recently addressed the homeless crisis, you know.’\n\n‘And by his grace we should do the same of them,’ she held her hand out at a dock worker who was slowly walking backward from another worker, ‘Not with token aid, but by our armed forces! Just as we will one day bring liberation to America over the madman Curtis and the rogue Lord Trembley, we shall do the same to Mewni. Our ideals, our prosperity, our democracy, by the grace of Norton!’\n\n‘And by the Imperial Governor’s grace, he knows the reality of our situation with Mewni, unlike you dear Lady. As much as they need our industry and food, we need their magical water, their knowledge of magic. That is the only thing keeping California afloat as the rest of the United States burns. They control our interdimensional communications and our ability to traverse dimensions. We lose that and California shall fall too! We are at each other’s mercy, Lady Everette. The first to pull the trigger would simply be the one responsible for both our deaths.’\n\nShe rolled her eyes, ‘For now, Lord Birnbaum. But soon, with Project Golden Gate, all of the multiverse shall be at our beck and call.’\n\nBirnbaum shook his head as she walked away"

Governor Guzman are debating on what to do. Norotn contemplates as Guzman makes a phone call. Shall we forgive the debt and restore the economy for Mewni? Can we spare the $650 in defualted debt?"
