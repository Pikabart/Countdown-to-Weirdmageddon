But standing in front of this invention of his, its humbling really. This was his achievement of a lifetime, a gateway to the universe and beyond. Its was his rise and because of me, it would be his fall.\n\nThirty years ago, that man was lost from our world, sucked up by the portal and into parts unknown. He was gone and I have labored since. To repair, to rebuild, to reinvent what I had thought anyway was the product of his mind. In his lost, I was changed to a new man. In my lost, he became known as a changed man. Across all the universe, across countless dimensions and realms that go beyond human comprehension, my quest to bring him back had led me to find more about myself. In that portal, I felt reborn, I felt broken, I stood on the shoulders of gods, and I saw where I really laid among the vast infinity.\n\nMaybe nothing has changed. But as that man once said, even in an isolated environment, nothing stays the same. I am not the man they think I am. I am not who I seem to be."

    awaits_journal.1.d:0 "Dipper stumbled about through the woods outside the shack, a hammer and some nails in hand and a couple of "Mystery Shack" arrow signs tucked in his arm. He grumbled about having to spend his time, if not his whole summer, working for his great Uncle Stanford's tourist trap. As he approached a tree to hang up a sign, that was about to change.\n\nHe steadied the nail and struck with the hammer. Instead of a nail through wood, a metal clank rang out. Dipper held his ear close to the tree bark and hit it again, the clear sound of something metallic and hollow beneath it. With a quick investigation, he found a fault line in the tree and pried it open. The hatch swung open, and he looked inside. An old machine. He toggled each switch. Then he heard the goat behind him run off as a cover on the ground opened up. Inside that was a journal under a layer of dust. He blew it off and opened and began to read its first page.\n\n“It's hard to believe it's been six years since I began studying the strange and wondrous secrets of Gravity Falls, Oregon...” he continued, turning to a page with the words “TRUST NO ONE”, “Unfortunately, my suspicions have been confirmed. I'm being watched. I must hide this book before he finds it. Remember: in Gravity Falls there is no one you can trust.”\n\nDipper wondered, “No one you can trust...”\n\nBehind him, Mabel appeared."

But before he could continue, the doorbell rang. Dipper asked who it was and after “spilling the beans”, she answered.\n\n“This girl's got a date! Woot woot!”\n\nAs she went to answer the door, Dipper sat down and kept reading. But when Stan walked in, he hid the journal and quickly picked up a magazine of Stan’s, Gold Chain for Old Men. A moment later, Mabel walked in.\n\n“Hey Family! Say hello to my new boyfriend!”\n\nHe turned around in his baggy and torn up black hoodie. His skin was pale, and his voice was scratchy. Twigs and grass sticked out his cloths as an odd red liquid dripped form his face.\n\n“So, what's your name?” asked Dipper.\n\nHe struggled, “Uh. Normal... MAN!”\n\nMabel clarified, “He means Norman.”\n\n“Are you bleeding, Norman?”\n\nHe looked down at his face, “It's jam.”\n\nMabel gasped, “I love jam! Look. At.

Zombie!”\n\nHe gasped and panic. He looked out the window, seeing Norman approach Mabel. He panicked, only to see him placed a necklace of daisies around her neck. He contemplated on what to do next, when Soos appeared, fixing a light bulb. He believed Dipper but reminded Dipper that he needed evidence to prove his theory, less he be ousted as a “a major league cuckoo clock”.\n\nSo, Dipper went out to watch over Mabel’s and Norman’s time together. Video Cam in hand, he took note of Norman’s behavior and felt confident to confront Mabel on his evidence. He showed her the Journal entry of the undead and Norman’s behavior. When he pointed out the author’s “Trust No One” line and his subsequent lack of trust in Mabel, she didn’t take it lightly.\n\n“Dipper, listen to me. Norman and I are going on a date at five o’clock, and I'm gonna be ADORABLE, and he's gonna be DREAMY!” She shoved him out of their room, “And I am not gonna let you ruin it with one of your crazy CONSPIRACIES!”\n\nAs she later left, Dipper sat in the living room, watching over the video of his observation of Norman and Mabel.\n\n“I guess I can be kind of paranoid sometimes and-”\n\nOn video, Norman’s hand fell off..."

Just... just keep an open mind, be cool!” He took of his jacket and hid disguise fell apart, reveal… five gnomes standing on top of each other. The gnome on top spoke, “Is this weird? Is this too weird? Do you need to sit down? R-r-right, I’ll explain. So! We’re gnomes. I’m Jeff, and here we have Carson, Steve, Jason and... I’m sorry, I always forget your name.\n\n“Shmebulock!”\n\nJeff explained their search for a new queen and their desire to make Mabel that new Queen. Their stacked person kneeing and a ring held out, they ask Mabel, “Will you join us in holy matrignomey? Matri...matri-mo-ny! Blah! Can’t talk today!” \n\n“Look... I'm sorry, guys. You're really sweet, but, I'm a girl, and you're gnomes, and it's like, "what"? Yikes...”\n\n“We understand. We'll never forget you, Mabel... Because we're gonna kidnap you.”\n\nThe five of them promptly jumped her. As her scream rang out in the distance, Dipper was rushing towards her with the Shack’s golf cart."

The gnomes are a powerful race! Do not trifle with the-”Dipper promptly swatted him with the shovel. Easily clearing them away, he rescued Mabel and they drove off in the golf cart.\n\nMable worried of them giving chase, but Dipper counted the gnomes were even able to come after them. Then loud and ground shacking footsteps rang out behind them right afterward. They turned back to see a giant gnome monster, made of thousands of smaller gnomes, began to run after them and chase them. Dipper swerved to avoid its hits as the individual gnomes jumped onto the cart. Mabel fought them off as Dipper kept racing back to the Shack. When one jumped on Dipper’s head, Mabel rushed into action and bashed him in the face several times before the gnome fell off, taking Dipper’s hat with him.\n\nThe chase continued when the giant gnome picked up a tree trunk and tossed it at the twins. Their cart crashed in front of the Shack. Back into a corner and Stan busy on the other side to hear, Jeff issued his ultimatum to marry him. Coming up with a plan, Mabel surprised Dipper by agreeing with Jeff. As Jeff awaited a kiss from her, she pulled out a leaf blower and sucked him in.\n\n“This for lying to me! That's for breaking my heart!” She maxed out the power setting, “And THIS is for messing with my brother! Dipper, wanna do the honors?”\n\n“On three!”\n\nThey took aim at the giant gnome monster with the leafblower, “One, two, three!”\n\nThey fired Jeff through the monster, explosion it back into hundred of little gnomes. As Jeff swore vengeance on them, the two of them celebrated.\n\n“Hey, Dipper? I, um...I'm sorry for ignoring your advice. You really were just looking out for me.”\n\n“Oh, don't be like that. You saved our butts back there.”\n\n“I guess I'm just sad that my first boyfriend turned out to be a bunch of gnomes.”"

You're off of register duty!”\n\n“Grunkle Stan, whatever happened to "please" and "thank you"? Hmm? Oh wait. Here they are!” She slapped two stickers saying those words on the cash register.\n\nStan rolled his eyes, “"Please" never made me any money, kid. In fact, just saying the word is giving me a burning sensation.\n\nDipper walked in, wearing a rather revealing wolf costume, “Grunkle Stan, why do I have to wear this wolf costume? I think I'm getting hookworm.”\n\nStan chuckled, “Yep. Gluing dog hair to your body will do that.”\n\n“All you care about is money at all cost!” said Mabel, “I bet you'd make way more money being nice then being a big grumpy grump to everyone all the time.\n\nStan waved her off, “Ha! You think you know more about business than I do? You think you could wear this hat?”\n\n“Yeah! 'Cause I give people respect! And glittery stickers!”\n\n“Ha! I'd make more money on vacation then you would, running this place!”\n\n“Then why don't you go on vacation?” goaded Mabel.\n\n“Interesting...” Stan then realized the real opportunity presented to him, besides being able to beat a little girl in a bet of pride, “All right, I'm a wagering man. If you make more money than me, I guess it means you're right about the way I run my business. BUT if you lose, you, uh... You have to wear this "LOSER" shirt all summer!”\n\n“Fine.

Then he smiled at her words. "Haha silly Wendy, you can't have dr-"\n\nIn an instant, a bright flash of blue light temporarily blinded Dipper while a deafening sound assaulted his ears. He was knocked back by a shockwave, and it took him a considerable amount of time to get himself on his feet. But as he forced one of his eyes to open, what he saw was astonishing.\n\nAll around Wendy, rays of light spun. She had donned on herself a Supreme 20th Anniversary Box Logo Tee, and over that a Supreme The North Face By Any Means Nuptse Jacket. She had an imposing stance, holding her own hands calmly. The deafening sound that accompanied the explosion was actually a musical note, the starting note of the song "Clash of the Gods" from the Dragon Claw Z Super OST, and the rest of the song was playing, seemingly from Wendy herself.

And tell him Mr. Kratin is here!”\n\n“Dude, look. I just man the cash register. I ain’t his secretary. Not at my pay.”\n\nImmediately upset, he began to trash about the place. Dipper ran over to see what was happening as the trench coat fell off and a hideous monster was revealed. Tourists turned and began to take pictures as it lunged out and attacked Wendy. As Dipper scrambled about, Wendy dodged and took out her axe and battle the beast. She managed to get a slash on its being, and another, hitting something else metallic in the process. Before she could deal another blow, it charged forward and pinned her to the floor, turning her axe around and the blade slowly approaching her face.\n\nSuddenly, a StanCo pan bashed the creatures head and dazed it. Wendy kicked it off and took back her axe. The monster regained its senses but realized it had lost. It retreated out and took out its magical scissors, which was now dented by the axe. He still managed to open a tear and leave. Back in the gift shop, the tourists inside were cheering on to two heroes for defeating the monster.\n\nAs Dipper dropped the pan and took deep breaths, exhausted by the ordeal, Wendy hugged him tight, picking him up and twirling around.\n\n“That dang creature nearly had me for moment! You totally came through for me!”\n\nDipper blush, “Uh, yeah, Anything for you Wendy... Wait, what did that thing want Stan for?”\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the other side of that tear, Mr. Kratin emerged. He looked around, wondering where his scissors took him. Suddenly a person walked up to him.\n\n“You!” he said, “But I was... how did you get here!”\n\nThe person raised her own axe and, with quick lethal efficiency, cut him to pieces without a second thought. Annebelle picked up the scissors, now broken beyond repair. She sighed, but was still satisified at her quick work of the monster she now stood on."

What was unexpected however was the exact timing, as there was not much in the way of an agreed successor to her seat. Quickly, the entire meeting between the Council and its members had devolved quickly into arguing and fighting over her seat as every business owner gave their mouth full of opinion.\n\nIn this chaos, it has become clear that two business owners in the service industry have emerged as the most likely candidate for the seat. The first is Stanford Pines, who runs the tourist popular Mystery Shack. The other is Buddy Gleeful, the owner of the Gleeful's Auto Sale and the legal owner of the local favorite Tent of Telepathy. Farmer Spur seems inclined to Gleeful, as Stan stole Spur’s cow. Preston oddly enough favors Pines, as Gleeful’s used car business interferes with his car industry.\n\nDuring the argument, Old Man McGucket approached Stan. Though he runs the Junkyard, Stan actually owns it after an agreement the two made decades ago. In a bout of sanity, he asked Stan to support having his son, Tate McGucket of the Lake Gravity Falls Pro Fish Shop, for the seat. A ridiculous idea, but Stan did think of it. Stan could barely muster support for the seat for himself and he would have little support from his own base on the council. But everyone likes Tate. Like the old McGucket, before he went insane, Stan knew he was a genius also. More importantly, Tate isn’t Bud, which alone is a good enough reason. Stan throwing support would ensure Tate gains the seat and a favor from both McGuckets could be worth far more than a seat. Especially since he had to pay monthly into the seat position if he won."

People grew angry at him and the twins for unleashing the ‘Madman’ Trembley. The police claimed they interfered with the operation to stop Trembley. Some went so far as to call Dipper an communist and Mabel an anarchist.\n\nStan arose to defend his grandnephew and grandniece. He won’t stand for such McCarthy statements. At the very least, Dipper was an anarchist and Mabel was a Communist.\n\n"The Man should pay for dinner? We beat the soviets so I don’t have to, Mabel!"\n\nThe town awaits Stan’s response. He spoke..."

He entered a normal looking conference room where the Town Council was meeting for the day.\n\nNothing about them betrayed a sense of abnormality among them. They were just regular people, living regular lives, elected regularly into office. The town charter even stated they were to be elected by normal means, unlike the mayor. Never have they been kissed by an eagle, unlike Befufftlefumpter or Governor Onyx, oddly enough. How lucky for them.\n\nBut Stan knew they had to play the game no more differently than everyone else. He held a folder in his arms to do the same. He took a seat down and the council began their meeting with him.\n\nThe head councilman spoke, "Mr. Pines. Thank you for meeting with us. We understand your wish to discuss and resolve... grievances each of our parties has between one another."\n\nStan turned to them, "I’m sure we can come to a new agreement."\n\n"I doubt we can come to a satisfactory resolution," said another councilman.\n\nA councilwoman spoke, "Tell us, Stanford Pines. How can you help us to help you... as a fair citizen of our beloved town of Gravity Falls?""

But I don't have the luxuary or care really to figure out this man. Driving up to his mansion on the south east end of town, near the Northwest's place, the old geezer had more guards on premise than President Curtis.\n\nArriving, I was escorted to his personal chambers, where he was feeding his giant turtle. It gave me a mean eye, but Befufftlefumpter paid no mind and had his assistant wheel him over.\n\n"Mayor Befufftlefumpter."\n\n"Mr. Pines."\n\nHe had me sit on a couch. As I waited for him, I took a look of some photos on the end table. There was him when he opened the watertower half a century ago. But there was him with someone I could swear I knew. I knew her, yet I did not.\n\n"A gift!" I nervously offered to him.\n\nHe didn't seeme to care too much for it. A fancy vase I traded some souvineers for from a tourist a few years back. A better deal than that goat I would imagine. I paniked and insitintaully took out my wallet. I guess I was now just going to bribe him. As I did do, the card holder unfurled. Befufftlefumpter took a look, and quickly latched on to a picture I had of this year's staff. He demanded to see it. I handed it over and he stared at it with revernce. I swear he began to tear up.\n\n"She looks just like Annebelle..."\n\n"So, uh, about the hillside..."\n\n"What? Oh yes that," He gave me the picture back, "You can have it."\n\n"Great!"\n\nI finished up the paperwork for the transfer. As I was about to leave, Befufftlefumpter turned to me.\n\n"Take good care of the Shack and your staff, Mr. §RStanley§! Pines."\n\nHe singled to be returned to his chambers."

Stan was set on a good second first impression. Fresh fake safety permits were pinned all over the fair, everything on a stick was extra battered and fried, and the prices were slashed (after a hidden increase). Once again, he sat atop the dunk tank. A money maker the first time around, he sat comfortable knowing the target lever everyone was aiming for was as solid as the redwood trees around them. He doubted any of them had a 64th century energy weapon.\n\nAcross the fair, Soos, Wendy, and the twins were at "The Time Masheen", Stan's latest ride at the fair. Acquired from a man who "liked money", the four of them were setting up the ride. As they took their seats, Soos looked at the control panel.\n\n"Normal Mode. Kill Charlie Chaplin Mode... hmmm, what's the harm in doing the second one?"\n\nWhen he engaged the machine, the entire ride began shaking. Soos held onto the control panel as the carts began to suddenly accelerate away, Wendy and the twins still in them. They all screamed as the ride approached a bright flash."

Mabel and Waddles sat dazed as Wendy turned to Dipper, who was grasping on to her. When he realized that, he quickly let go and back off before nervously laughing it off.\n\nThey got off and walked out back onto the fair. As they looked around, all the rides and attractions were the same, but everyone was wearing different clothing: darker, sharper, punkier. One guy walled by, dressed in black with spiked shoulders.\n\n"Woah, is that a punked out Toby?" asked Wendy. She turned to look elsewhere.\n\nDipper picked up a newspaper from the trash can, "Presidential Candidate Ronald Regan criticized President Carter over letting Canada handle the Able Archer Crisis. BABBA begins their final tour around the world. New Tourist Attraction 'The Mystery Shack' begins their first ever Mystery Fair," he checked the date, "1984!"\n\nMabel sighed..."

Wearing a varsity jacket and making a show of it, the kid turned to the teen.\n\n"Feast your eye, carrot-top, as Sutter Middle School’s premier Quarterback, Piedmont League’s greatest pitcher, wins you that stuffed creature of indeterminate species over your head."\n\nShe giggled in amusement at him, "Sure thing, Short Stop."\n\n"Dipper, that's Dad!

Here’s your stuffed animal of indeterminate species.”\n\nDipper ran over to check on her. But Eugene stopped him and picked him up by his collar.\n\n"Hey! Is this your girl?"\n\n"What? That's my sister! And let go of me!"\n\n"Heck no! You dumb sister nearly ruined my shot! And I'm going to make you pay for it!"\n\n"Wait, hold on!"\n\nAs he raised his fist, the teen that was with him spoke out, "Gene!"\n\n"Yeah, Carrot-"\n\nHer fist plowed through from one side to the other side of his face.

You three shouldn’t be in this time period!” He made them grab hold of each other and he took out his time machine, the tape measure, to send them back to the present. As soon as they got back, he asked, “What was the device that brought you back to 1984?”\n\nSoos ran over to them, “Oh dudes, you’re alright! The Time Masheen went haywire and is still going! I thought the ride would have squashed you all to liquid... or something.”\n\nBlendin took a step forward, “Stand aside!” He took out an energy pistol and took aim at the Time Masheen. He fired a tiny energy bolt at the ride. A few quiet seconds later, the entire ride exploded ifa fierce blaze as sparks flew up in the sky. People around the fair stopped to stare at the bright lights and applauded at what they thought was a fireworks show. As the Time Masheen laid in a wreck, he turned back to them.\n\n“And don’t go around messing with the timeline. Y-y-you don’t want me coming back again!”\n\nBlendin took out his time machine and left. Soos turned to them, holding the charred remains of a T-Rex wearing an American M-1 Helmet."

Let’s see if Daddy’s little girl can do better than Manly Dan!”\n\nShe groaned in annoyance, “Let’s make it interesting then. If I dunk you, Mr. Pines. I get the week off with pay. If I don’t, I’ll work free the rest of the summer!”\n\nStan laughed, “Oh, alright. I’m a betting man. Have at me, Wendy!”\n\nWendy got into the position. She raised her arm and took aim.

Just off angled from Stan, the ball smashed through the glass container and broke the wooden bean holding Stan’s seat. Before he could realize what happened, Stan fell into the water, still able to hear the gargled cheers of the crowd that had gathered around the Corduroys.\n\n“The ol’ “Think outside the box”, or inside in this case,” she smiled and shrugged as the crowd cheered.\n\n“Haha, she has the Corduroy Arm!” Manly Dan exclaimed to everyone.

    mystery_shack_ship_end.1.d:0 "They were parked on the side of the road leading to the onramp for the Oregon Redwood Highway. Dipper looked back at the Town of Gravity Falls. Run out by Gideon and the townsfolk under his control, he stared out in shock at everything that had happened. The Shack was gone. The Journal was gone. His sister was gone. A few tears dropped from his cheeks. But he wiped his eyes and turned to Stan. Leaning back on the hood of his car, Stan stared at the ground. Dipper snapped his finger to grab his attention. Finally, Dipper yelled at him. “Grunkle Stan! We have to go back. We can’t leave Mabel with Gideon...  Stan? Stan!? We can’t leave Mabel!”\n\n“She left us, Dipper!” Stan finally snapped. He slid down and sat on the ground, “I should have done more. I let this happen...” He took off his fez and leaned back to the car, “I let it happen again.” Dipper turned to him, noticing what he said. Stan preempted him, “That book that Gideon took from you. What was it?”\n\n“The Journal? It’s... you won’t believe me. It's this journal of all the “weird and paranormal” stuff in this town... If there's one thing Gideon wanted more than Mabel, it was that Journal.” Dipper sighed, “What's the use? I don’t even know who wrote it. He likely has the first two as well.”\n\n“Journal 3?” He stood back up and started back at the town. “We need to go!”\n\n“To town?” asked Dipper.\n\n“What? No! We’re dead if we step foot back in. We need help. Your grandfather Shermie, California. They have the means to stop what Gideon is doing.”\n\nStan got into the car, Dipper followed in. But he demanded, “Grunkle Stan, you know something, don’t you? You lived here for thirty years, you must know of all the weird things happening in this town!”\n\nHe turned on the ignition, then turned to him, “You’re right kid. I do. Of course I know of all the weird things in this town! I was pretending to ignore them so you and Mabel would too! Look how that turned out!?”\n\n“You must know something then. About the Journals. The author?”\n\nStan stared at Dipper for a moment, then turned away. “Kid. Those journals are more dangerous than anything you ever encountered around these woods. If Gideon were to get his hands on all three, nothing would save us.” Stan reached into his coat and pulled out a worn out red binded book, “Fortunately, you’re wrong about what Gideon has.”\n\nHe gave it to Dipper. He read the front, “Journal 1? Grunkle Stan, you had a journal?”\n\nStan started the engine and drove off towards the highway, “The Journals cost you your twin. Just as it had mine.”\n\n“Your twin?”\n\n“The author of the journals...”"

What did I ever see in him?”\n\n“I told you.”\n\n“You’re not helping Dipper!” she yelled at him throw the window.\n\nDipper tossed a fit, “I warned you from the start, Mabel!

Why protect her?”\n\n“Because you don’t need it!” Stan walked over to them, “Shermie was always worried that you two would end up like...”\n\nMabel looked out the window, “Like what?” \n\n“Like me... and my twin.”\n\n“Wait,” Dipper was confused, “You had a twin?”\n\nStan snorted, “Your dad and Shermie didn’t want you two to know until you were older. Stanford and Stanley, five minutes apart. We were just like you two. Inseparable. But then we drifted apart...” He took out the first Journal first his coat. Dipper and Mabel both looked on in shock at what Stan had, “Now, this is all I had of him.”\n\n“Your twin wrote the Journals? Stanley is the Author? You knew of them the whole time!?”\n\n“Despite the order, he reminds me of you, Dipper, as Mabel does to me. I guess I was taking my frustration of him out on you... I’m sorry.”\n\nDipper thought about his words, “But wait. You said Stanley is like me. But you’re the older one, like Mabel.”\n\n“Kid, I’m Stanley Pines. The Author of the Journals...”"

Mabel looked on in shock as he led her down the stairs. In front of them now was an elevator. They entered and after jumping for it multiple times, Mabel pressed the “Third Level” Gideon was trying to press.

    mystery_shack_ship_end.4.d:0 "“Fire in the hole! Haha!”\n\nAnd with a bang, part of the walls of the shack was blown away. The ground underneath gave way. As rubble continued to fall here and there, Gideon jumped into the hole leading into a previously unknown basement for the shack. He looked around with a lantern, shining it on the odd artifacts in the sub-room.\n\n“Where is that journal? I know Stanford hid it in this creepy den of his!”\n\nThe elevator then turned on. Gideon turned to it in a startled panic, only to see McGucket walk out.\n\n“There was an elevator!” McGucket pondered for a moment, “Not sure why I know that?”\n\nGideon yelled at him, “That would have been nice to know before you blew a hole in my new property!”\n\n“And miss dynamiting stuff? You're crazy!”\n\nGideon sighed. Looking at the elevator itself, he noticed they were on the “Second Floor” of the basement. They boarded back on and descended to the third last floor of the basement. Coming out, they were both shocked by the new room they found. Computers, monitors, and advanced equipment lined the walls of the room. Gideon approached the central console and opened up the book cubby.

    mystery_shack_pining.1.d:0 "Mabel approached Dipper for help with Gideon. For as much as she tried to bring it to an end with Gideon, he keeps bringing her with a mix allure of lavish events and the guild of outright saying no. Wanting this to finally come to an end, Dipper went to Gideon himself. Straight to the point of the matter, Gideon seemed to have taken the news well, so Dipper thought.\n\nShortly afterward, Dipper received a call from Toby Determined.  After a brief chat and a short apology of accusing Toby of murder a short while back, he told Dipper that he wanted to interview him about his unusual sightings around town. Excited, he agreed and got the address for the location. A 412 Gopher Road, tonight.\n\nUp at the old warehouse overlooking the town, Dipper was instead greeted by Gideon, sitting across the warehouse from him. Quickly annoyed to encounter him once more, Dipper was quick to ask if this meetup was about Mabel, making clear once more that she wasn’t into him.\n\nSuch a statement prompted a response from him. Gideon grasped his amulet, and with its power he grabbed hold of Dipper with its power and tossed him across the warehouse. Dipper grabbed a Gideon Brand bat and tried to fight him off. But Gideon’s powers proved too much, and he pinned Dipper down. Grabbed lamb sheering scissors, Gideon moved in on Dipper.\n\nThen Mabel entered. Gideon quickly drop the sheers. Acting quickly, she made it clear herself she didn’t want to be with him. Approaching him and her eye on the amulet, she offered to at least be friends catching Gideon off guard for her to quickly take it back and the amulet off his beady neck as well. Mabel tossed it to Dipper, but Gideon rushed and tackled him out the window and over the cliff edge.\n\nJust as they were about to hit, the glow of the amulet surrounded them and set them down on the ground. Form above, Mabel floated down to them with the amulet.\n\n“Listen Gideon, it's over. I will never, ever, date you.” And she smashed the amulet.\n\n“MY POWERS!” He stared down both of them, “Oh this isn't over...”"

The margins are smaller, but with overall high profits and foot traffic, his Shack and the Mystery Sale was drawing away people from Gideon. As much as he wants better Short Term Quarterly Profits Margins, he knew the old saying.\n\n"He who sells and cuts prices, may turn and sell another day.

Dipper sat up from the copier as the copy of him came to life and popped out from the sheet of paper.\n\n“Now this... this is the third weirdest thing I saw in my life,” said Stan.\n\nThe new clone stood up and turned to Dipper, “Alright then. I guess I’m the first of many.”\n\nMabel spoke, “What should we call this Dipper?”\n\nDipper snapped his fingers, “He’s my new number 2. So I guess-“\n\n“I’m a new Tyrone! Awesome!”\n\nMabel yanked Dipper off the copier, “I want a clone with a cool name now!”\n\nAll three of them quickly pulled Mabel back. “We don’t need another Mabel around... not yet anyway,” said Stan.

But there was something wrong with some of the clone dippers.\n\nAs Tyrone began to run them through a basic obstacle course for training, some of the Dippers snapped and began attacking each other. The brawl was fierce, mostly as each individual dipper was weak and their noodle-like arms made little damaged against each other. None the less, the brawl turned into a riot as more dippers broke from formation and battled.\n\nTyrone ran to the garden faucet and turned on the sprinklers. As water fell on his newly laminated skin, the other Dippers got soaked and the paper body of theirs melted away.\n\nStan came outside to see what was happening.\n\n"Some of the Dippers just went crazy!"\n\nStan gave it a thought, "Maybe, as each clone of Dipper was made, some deep underlining subconscious took the place of his regular copied persona during the process. Once alive, this caused some dippers to be act differently and even rebel from being a "Dipper"."\n\n"Wow... didn't know you were that philosophical?"\n\nStan commented, "Heard someone say it on tv.”"

After a few seconds, the new Wendy stood up and turned to the original Wendy.\n\nWendy asked, “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”\n\n“That we totally go and mess with Thompson?” the clone replied.\n\n“Woah, she really is a straight copy of me!”\n\nThe clone laughed, “You bet! Though I wish you were being paid extra for this.”\n\n“You know I got suckered into Stan’s “Gideon is a threat to us all” splee.”\n\n“Yeah, that was lame... Dippers?”\n\nAll three Dippers in the room stared on in awe of the two Wendys. Tyrone was the first to realize they were staring too long and managed to respond, “Uh, so what should we, uh, call you? Wendy two?”\n\nBoth of them thought for a moment of a new name to distinguish the two. Then in unison, they pointed at each other in agreement.\n\n“Annebelle!” they both said.\n\nAnnebelle turned to Tyrone, “But you can call me Annie for short.” She took off her hat and wrote a “A” on it. “There we go!”\n\n“Cool, cool... why Annebelle?”\n\nAt the door, Robbie walked in with a bouquet of flowers, “Wendy, I came here to apologies to you...” He stared at the two Wendys in disbelief. After a short awkward pause, his nose bleed out and he fell face first onto the floor.\n\nThen Stan walked by, noticing three Dippers, Two Wendys, and an unconscious Robbie."

    mystery_shack_muse.1.d:0 "Dipper sat the edge of the attic window. The light outside shined through the trained window, giving a red hue that filled the room. He opened the journal and turned to first few pages. There the author had wrote about his muse.\n\n“...I know how it sounds, but a strange being forma higher plane took sympathy with my search for knowledge and amazingly chose me to be a receptacle for divine and otherworldly insight...”\n\nHe pondered what this muse was. More so, he was now hoping whoever it was the author turned to, he could do the same as well for help in stopping Gideon. Dipper began to flip a few more pages when he stumbled on an odd-looking page. There were no words. Just a picture, maybe a diagram of some design. Circuit like lines like he would see from his dad’s files from work, but a third of a large triangular device. Before he could turn the next page, Stan walked in.\n\n“Hey, Dipper. What are you doing here?”\n\nHe hid the journal, “What, uh, nothing, Grunkle Stan.”\n\n“So you say,” he wondered as well, “Come on. Your claim of the copier is right. A picture of my arm came to life and stole my Pitt Cola, before dissolving itself like an idiot. Get to the machine and let’s start making us an army!”\n\nDipper grumbled as he closed the journal and left it at the window. After he left the room, the light from the red window grew brighter and the eye at the center suddenly moved and turned down to look at the journal."

He was being consumed by the constant torment of his Grunkle Stan, being ordered to do a series of menial task from cutting wood, catching bats, being strapped to the copier to produce an army of clones. All while everything Dipper been trying to say to Stan is ignored.\n\nAs he slowly grew angry and resentful, his mind then cleared up. Laying on the ground, he stood up and looked around in what looked like an abandon and empty Shack.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hey there, Pine Tree!”\n\nDipper turned around and was startled at the sight of this floating yellow triangle. The creature took off his hat and introduced himself.\n\n“Name’s Bill. Bill Cipher. Hope you don’t mind me popping in on your dream here,” he leaned into to Dipper’s ear, “I been hearing through the interdimensional grapevine that you need some help?”\n\n“I do,” Dipper realized, “Are you the Author’s muse?”\n\n“Oh me? Well, that depends.”\n\n“I have the Third Journal. He talks about you, the reason he achieved what he had managed to find about Gravity Falls.”\n\nBill asked, curious, “And nothing else?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“Not important, Pine Tree. Look, you seem like a nice kid. A competent one at that too! So, when you really need me most, give me a call,” the journal appeared before them and turned to a page deep in the journal, “Read this when you need me most and I’ll come a running. Got it?”\n\n“Yes, Bill!”\n\n“Great! Also, remember! Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold, BYE!"\n\nDipper woke up. He quickly looked around, seeing Mabel on the other bed sleeping with Waddles. He took a deep breath and looked down, startled to see the journal open on his laps.

That Gideon summoned him and ordered him to go into Stan’s mine and steal the combination to the safe. You know, to get the deed to the Mystery Shack.”\n\n“What? Alright then,” Dipper took out the Journal, “Let me see what I can find here…” as he flipped the pages towards the one Bill had given him. But it weas then he stumbled on the pages right before, the entire page covered in black ink and odd red stains. He read it. “My Muse was a Monster?!” he turned the page, “Bill Cipher.

Do not summon at all cost!”\n\nStan suddenly began to jerk around, flailing about in his seat. Tyrone and his dippers rushed into see what was happening. Stan’s eyes then opened as bright blue lights shot out of his eyes and mouth. An unsettling aurora sent chills up everyone’s back as it went through the room and entered Stan.\n\nMabel took the journal and flipped to the next page, “It is possible to follow the demon into a person's mind and prevent his chaos. One must simply recite this incantation.”\n\n“That’s the one Bill told me. He’s trying to lure us into a trap! Ugh, this is just great. I spend all day cleaning sinks and fighting bats for Stan and now I have to save him from some crazy brain demon?”\n\n“But if we don't do anything Gideon might steal the shack?

As the approached the porch of the Shack, Bill appeared.\n\n“Pine Tree! How nice of you to stop by!”\n\nDipper pointed at him, “The jigs up, Bill. We know who you are and what you are here for.”\n\n“You leave our uncle's brain alone, you isosceles monster!” Mabel rushed to tackle Bill, but went right through him instead, “Gotcha! Wait, what?”\n\n“Ah, Shooting Star and Pine Tree. You even have your own dimension’s Quention Mark here. I had a feeling I’ll meet you here. As for stopping me, well... fat chance! I'm the master of the mind. Not even your precious author could stop me.”\n\nWith the whim of his power, he demonstrated his powers, from blasting a hole through Dipper’s chest to bringing Xyler and Craz to life from Mabel’s mind alive.\n\n“You're out of your league, kids. Turn around now before you see something you might regret. Later, suckers!” and Bill shacked his way through the Shack and Stan’s inner mind.\n\nThey all gave pursuit, Xyler and Craz hoisting Mabel up in her own arm throne as Dipper blocked his eyes from their bright 80s glare.

    mystery_shack_muse.5.d:0 "Dipper wondered the hallway of all of Stan’s memories of Dipper. There was growing resentment as he watched all the demeaning things Stan made him do. As he wondered about, he came upon as scene of Stan making him cut firewood as he and Soos watched from the porch. Soos asked Stan why he was so hard on him.\n\n“Look at the kid He’s a loser. He's weak! He's an utter embarrassment! I just wanna get rid of him.\n\nDisheartened by his words, Dipper quickly turned around to leave, but overheard one last line form Stan.\n\n“Heh, yeah... Those are all things people said about me when I was a boy.”\n\nDipper turned back around, “Huh?”\n\n“It was terrible. I was the biggest wimp on the playground. So one summer, my pop signs up me for boxing lessons. It was even worse than the school yard! 	Y'know, that time I thought my pop was trying to torture me. But wouldn't you know it? The old man was doin' me a favor all along!” Dipper watched the different memories of Stan’s own training, leading to him even stopping a robbery, “When the time came, I could stand up for myself, for others. You see it? That why I'm hard on Dipper. To toughen him up. So, when the world fights, he fights back.”\n\n“Do you think it's actually working?” asked Soos.\n\nAll three of them watched the moment when Dipper finally managed to chop the firewood in half.\n\n“He's really comin' along! When push comes to shove, I'm actually proud of him. Just... don't ever tell him that. His head is big enough as it is.”\n\nDipper smiled, touched by those words. He placed his hand on the barrier between him and the memory, before suddenly falling through it. Stan turned to him as he landed on the ground, turning back to the memory dipper in the yard. “Whoa, kid, what are you doin' here? Nice hole in your chest, by the way. Let's fix that up,” he pointed at Dipper’s chest and sealed his body up.\n\n“Wh-what the- How did you do that?” Dipper asked.\n\n“Word to the wise, kid. We're in the mind! You can do whatever you imagine in here!”\n\n“Well how about that? So, what you said earlier...”\n\n“You heard that, did you? You’ll be fine kid. In a way, I see a lot of me in you. I just... I don’t want to see you make the same mistakes I did, for you and your sister’s sake.”\n\nSuddenly the sound of screaming of Mabel and Soos came through from the hallway as explosions and blasts rang out. Dipper turned back around. “Oh my gosh, what am I doing? I gotta stop Bill!”\n\nStan watched as he left. He drank his Pitt Cola and smiled."

    mystery_shack_muse.6.t:0 "He won't stop here..."
    mystery_shack_muse.6.d:0 "Dipper arrived as Bill was gaining the upper hand. Foiled in getting his hands on the code and Gideon subsequently canceling the deal, Bill was set to dish out vengeance on Mabel and Soos. But with the power of the mind and renewed spirit, Dipper rallied them to use their imagination to fight back at Bill. The three of them initially gained the upper hand and drove Bill back. Having turned bill’s own domain against him, Bill unleashed his powers to stop the attacked and turned to them.\n\n“You know, I'm impressed with you guys. You're a lot more clever than you look. Especially the fat universal constant one.”\n\nSoos whispered to Mabel, “He's talking about you...”\n\nBill dusted off his top hat, “So, I'm gonna let you kids off the hook. You might come in handy later. BUT KNOW THIS: A darkness approaches. A day will come in the future when everything you care about will change! Until then I'll be watching you... I'LL BE WATCHING YOU.!”\n\nThey arrived back at the living room. As they woke back up, they all heard the commotion outside. They rushed out as the clone dippers drove back a team of Gideon’s goons. As they retreated, they saw a crane with a wrecking ball coming right after them, Gideon in the driver’s seat. Just as it was about to stop and smash its wrecking ball at the Shack, two Wendys appeared from the bushes and jumped onto the crane’s cabin. \n\nAxes at hand, they broke into the cabin and one of them yanked Gideon right out, tossing him into the ground. The other one got in quickly and diverted the crane back into he woods before they both leaped out.\n\nThe two Wendys walked over, greeted by both Dipper and Tyrone.\n\n“Wendy, Annebelle!”\n\nThey both responded at once, “Sup?”\n\nThey all turned back to the road, where Gideon was.\n\n“This isn’t over! I will get the journals! And you will all pay!” he then snapped is figures and got one of his goons to pick him up and run back home.\n\nDipper spoke, “He won’t stop. If we don’t get his journal, he’ll just keep coming after us...”\n\n“Agreed,” said Tyrone.\n\nStan then walked out onto the porch."

    mystery_shack_war.1.t:0 "The Mabel Raid"
    mystery_shack_war.1.d:0 "Sneaking through to the other side of town, Dipper and Wendy held position just outside Gideon’s house. Several of his goons were guarding the front lawn. Right on cue, Mabel appeared. She walked up to the gate and was quickly stopped. But she called out to Gideon, and he looked out his window, utterly enchanted at the idea she came back to him. As he ordered his guards to let her in, the two of them moved in.\n\nWendy did most of the fighting and took out the goons with ease. Dipper walked over and took out the height-altering flashlight. With a pink flash, he shrunk himself and Wendy tossed him up to Gideon’s window. He awaited as Mabel performed her role.\n\nThey sat on his bed, staring at each other’s eyes, “Oh Mabel, my dear. I knew you would come to your senses. Your evil uncle and brother messed with your mind. But with Gideon, all is well. All is clear.”\n\n“You are so right, Gideon,” said Mabel, “And I have a gift to make it up to you!” She pulled out the third Journal, “I took it from my stupid brother.”\n\nGideon was surprised, “Three! There’s three? Oh Mabel. You never cease to amaze me. This only affirms what I know. Your great uncle has Journal 1! And it will be mine!”\n\n“Let me help you,” she looked around, “What about your journal? Maybe I can help you find something to defeat Stan.”\n\n“Oh Mable,” Gideon blushed. He led her to his desk by the window and took out the second Journal, “Here my love. Just one more and we shall rule the world, together.”\n\nMabel smiled as she picked up the second journal, “Here’s the thing...” She then bashed him across the face with it as Dipper grew back to normal size and opened the window, “I rather die than be with you! Dipper!”\n\nHe caught the second journal and jumped off the roof, Wendy catching him. Gideon was horrified, but he at least reached for the third journal. He opened it, only to see a book full of Mabel’s ‘Caticature’. He turned back to Mabel. There, she was holding a bottle of Diet Pitt and a mentos. With a drop, the entire room was coated in cola. The fake journal was destroyed and as Gideon slowly stood back up, grossed out and sticky, he gasped at the sight of the clone Mabel dissolving.\n\n“With my last breath... suck it Gideon!”\n\nUtterly enraged, he yelled out."

    mystery_shack_war.7.d:0 "Stan stared at the cover of Journal 2 and 3.\n\n"To think that little brat Gideon had a Journal this whole time. I wished mine had some tricks to con people more easily. And Dipper, finding the third one just a month ago? He really does remind me of old sixer..."\n\nHe opened up the three journals and laid them out on the table. Heading to the special pages in each one, he turned to the console and inputted the final coordinates and settings into the computer. A quiet moment passed, then the control room came alive. Once dormant or half power machines came to life with the electric humming of 80s circuitry as Stan watched in disbelief. He turned around to see as the portal activated. He rushed out and approached the portal. Open, it was only the second time he had ever seen the portal in this new state. Bright, intense, surging with energy. All the indicators to the side indicated full operational status. He looked on as he felt a gust flow through the room.\n\n“Thirty long years, and it’s all led up to this. My greatest achievement!”\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you everyone for playing through the first alpha of Countdown to Weirdmageddon.
