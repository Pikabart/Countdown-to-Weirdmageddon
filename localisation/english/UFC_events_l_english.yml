 UFC_START_EVENT.1.t:0 "The Roars of the Forest"
 UFC_START_EVENT.1.d:0 "Up in the mountains of Northeast Oregon was a series of deep and interacted caves. Far from the eyes of the gnomes and taunts of the manotaurs was the home of the Multi-Bears, ferocious yet calm beast with multiple heads and an intelligence to match. Often found in slumber and hibernation, these creatures of the forest of Gravity Falls once had little care of the day-to-day activities at the base of their mountain, where the rule of Gnome Queen reign supreme and kept order. In their their caves they have their solitude and 80s music.\n\nNow though, that time of peace had come to an end. The Death of the Gnome Queen has thrown the Forest into disarray. With the Gnomes in retreat, and the Manotaurs and Unicorns taking control of their local area, so has the time come that the Multi-bears emerged from their caves and spread out to bring order to land. There were little the disorganized denizens of the forest could do against these multiheaded bears.\n\nBut between the brutish Manotaurs and the ever-manipulative Unicorns, the Multi-Bears and their intellect and poise could very well be the key to a new future in the Forest. As the Long Summer begins and Gravity Falls turn a Blind Eye to what rumbles in the woods, a fight has broken out. The Manotaurs have crossed the river Trembley, and the Bears stand ready to drive them back. Even in the deepest part of the Forest, any rumble will soon be heard by all."

 UFC_MANWAR.1.t:0 "A Final Plea For Help"
 UFC_MANWAR.1.d:0 "Two FPI agents stood by the post at the road leading up to the mayoral mansion. Part of the special division assigned to the former director as part of the agreement for him to step down, they watched from a computer in their guard booth as the different elements of the FPI were splintered across the country, thankful they were not part of that mess of a kerfuffle. It was then they heard a commotion in the treeline. The agents took position and aimed their firearms at the woods. It was then that a multibear emerged from the tree line, standing in massive form over twice the agent's height. It spoke.\n\n”I have a meeting with the Mayor.”\n\nThey turned to each other for a moment, but did a quick call with their radio to command about it. With an approval from up above, they lowered their firearms and let the bear through. It ascended in quick order up the hill and was welcomed through the front door by an unphased butler. Entering a large den, the butler entered with the bear and walked towards the wheelchair facing away. He wheeled its occupant over to the bear.\n\n”I see you have come. What can I do for your kind that raised me?” asked Mayor Befufftlefumpter.\n\nJohn Multibear made his case. The Manotaurs intend to launch a full attack along the northern River Trembley. They needed weapons and supplies to repel the attack. Befufftlefumpter nodded, but seemed hesitant to intervene. Even a man once as powerful as him now must bow to other forces. Even a Blind Eye can see. But he was not unsympathetic. He agreed to help. The amount was not high as John would have liked, but perhaps its quality would make the difference. That’s always been the case of Franco-German Engineering.\n\nHe gave his thanks to the adopted son of his people."
 UFC_MANWAR.1.a:0 "Thank you, Dear Uncle"

 UFC_COUNCIL.1.t:0 "Unite the Eastern Banks"
 UFC_COUNCIL.1.d:0 "Our victory in driving the Manotaurs back up to their smelly "Man Cave" in the hills has brought most of the Northern Forest of Gravity Falls under our control. A council has convened to discuss the post-war situation. With our independence from the Gnomes and many critters of the Forest under our catrol, all the heads seemed in agreement that we must fill the power vacuum. But while we are strong enough to fill the gap, the Forest cannot survive with just the north. That fact brought the next question. The unicorn question.\n\nWith each multi-bear came multiple opinions from each head. The obnoxious unicorns are no Manotaurs, but it doesn't mean we like them. But they hold the economical heart of the forest and have themselves a massive wealth. Still, as they offered us support during the war, so likely had they given aid to those beasts, hoping to buy a winner no matter who won. With so much arguing, John Multibear was quick to end the discussion, having full control of his heads. The choice was made. The good of the Forest means the Unicorns will play a role in that.\n\nIt will be the Unicorns to decide what that role is..."
 UFC_COUNCIL.1.a:0 "Send the messenger Druid to the Enchanted Grove"
 
 UFC_COUNCIL.2.t:0 "The Multi-Bears Have A Proposal For Us"
 UFC_COUNCIL.2.d:0 "The Unicorns were awoken. Partly from a small druid gnome chanting the sound that would bring the Enchanted Grove from its magical hiding place, but also to a banging headache of a hangover from the rave they had the night before. One of the unicorns managed to walk to the doors of the inner realm and check who distrubed them. Opened, the druid gnome walked in and handed them a letter.\n\n"Message from the MultiBears. They wish to discuss the future of the forest," he said with a deep baritone voice.\n\nThey gathered around a rock table as their faun servant brought them coffee. Celestabellebethabelle opened the letter with her horn. After a quick read, they all laughed at the request from the Multibears to form a united forest council with them. After a moment, it dawned on them implications of what was going on.\n\nThe bears have mobilized a significant force during their battle against the Manotaurs. It had occurred to them that force is still active and now on their border. Worse, the "army" they have for controlling their part of the forest are merely local militias united only to keep Jeff and his gnomes on the western side of the River Trembley. If the bears invade, many would lay down their arms or even join them to destroy them. But of course. These multibears are smelly beasts, little better than the Manotaurs. Joining them is unthinkable... which, if done correctly, could be the ultimate scam they could play on the bears!"
 UFC_COUNCIL.2.a:0 "Let them have their "Forest" Council..."
 UFC_COUNCIL.2.b:0 "It'll save us the effort!"
 UFC_COUNCIL.2.c:0 "Tell The Smelly Brutes\n"NO"!"
 
 UFC_COUNCIL.3.t:0 "The Unicorns Agree!"
 UFC_COUNCIL.3.d:0 "It be an understatement to say, but the Multibears were surprised the Unicorns agreed! Forming a united government will be challenging, but the Forest will have a new future to look forward to in this long, long summer!"
 UFC_COUNCIL.3.a:0 "For the Forest!"
 
 UFC_COUNCIL.4.t:0 "The Unicorns Reject Our United Forest"
 UFC_COUNCIL.4.d:0 "For the leader of multiple heads, multiple bears, and many, many critters of the forest, the news of the Unicorns rejecting their offer was an unsurprising if still unfortunate event. But for his compatriots, it was the casus belli they waited for. From hibernation before the long summer, the death of the Gnome Queen triggered a new aggression in the Multibears. Once isolationist, the bears' victory over one old enemy has rekindled their interest in the affairs of the forest. And the power they wield was hard to give up.\n\nNow that the unicorns refuse their peace offer, the same rally can be made against them. War was now inevitable. John MultiBear lamented over the fact his kind were on path to be as aggressive as the Manotaurs and controlative as the Unicorns they will now fight. But to victory he will lead them nonetheless."
 UFC_COUNCIL.4.a:0 "We will win the peace!"
 
 UFC_COUNCIL.5.t:0 "The Measure of Representation"
 UFC_COUNCIL.5.d:0 "The first Council meeting has begun. Though there were representatives from all the sentient races of the Forest, the Multi Bears and the Unicorns were the real two sides of the debate. The first matter was of the future permanent council that will run the government. Many have persuaded the Bears to stick with equal representatives so no one race can dominate the council. The unicorns have backed a proportional representation. Though by default, the unicorns do not have a large population, many gnomes and other weaker races are firmly under their control and they number enough to be a significant minority if not the occasional majority of the new Council. Obviously, if the bears refuse this, they’ll win and have more overall races to side with them. But the Unicorns are prepared to bargain to get their way in this matter."
 UFC_COUNCIL.5.a:0 "Representation By Population Count It Shall Be"
 UFC_COUNCIL.5.at:0 "§Y¢100§! §7Cryptid Currency§! will be added to our reserve"
 UFC_COUNCIL.5.b:0 "Equal Representation For All!"
 
 UFC_COUNCIL.6.t:0 "All Animals Are Equal..."
 UFC_COUNCIL.6.d:0 "The next agenda was the matter of equality. Though the Gnomes claimed they ruled fairly, it was clear there was an upper class race over all the rest in the forest. While some Gnomes would like that system back, it was clear under Jeff’s short regency that it was a horrible system and something must be done. The Multi Bears propose a full, detailed equality article in the charter of the Council to bring equality to all. The unicorns were not necessarily against the article itself, but didn’t want to dwell on its details. If shortened, this can be abused by clearly more powerful races, bear and unicorn alike, to make them the favored ones in a forest of equals. But even some bears are willing to support this. John Multi Bear must decide."
 UFC_COUNCIL.6.a:0 "... Whether they be Mano, Multi, Uni, or Gnome"
 UFC_COUNCIL.6.b:0 "... But Some Are More Equal Than Others"
 UFC_COUNCIL.6.bt:0 "§Y¢200§! §7Cryptid Currency§! will be added to our reserve"
 
 UFC_COUNCIL.7.t:0 "The Prime Ministership"
 UFC_COUNCIL.7.d:0 "As the rest of the Charter was finished drafting and was at this point on the verge of a ceremonial official approval, new political parties were forming. It was clear the old ways leaders rose to power will have no effect here. In what was new to both of them, John and Celestabellebethabelle must rally their supporters and form deals to make coalitions to win control of the Council and its Prime Ministership.\n\nBut there was a loophole too. There was only one office to the PM, but some have realized two people can hold that same office at once! Some party members from the Bear Bloc and the Unicorn Bloc have met to discuss a deal. All of them will simultaneously vote in John and C-Bell as the Prime Minister. Both would rule from their position and force a grand coalition of the Council, making needed bills in this early state of the United Forest Council easier to pass and keep the UFC together as a whole."
