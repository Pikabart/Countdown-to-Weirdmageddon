Thousands of pounds of corn are going missing, with entire silos being found full one day and then empty the next!\n\nIt is beleived by the Magic High Commision that a new family of rats is the culprit, and they are working hard to stop them. However, these rats are extremeley well organized, and will likley be able to evade eradication for the forseeable future.\n\nThe populace is already preparing for the worst, hiding corn under mattreses and stockpiling weapons in case of societal collapse."

One of these is the Mewman guard, and with a lack of money the government had no choice but to let off the majority of mercanaries. This has backfired though, as throwing thousands of trained warriors out onto the street was not a good idea.\n\nRobbery, burglary, extortion, and black market supply are all up. Gangs are forming, with organized raids on both civillian and government warehouses being carried out. And with the imperial police department lacking funds, they seem unlikley to stop anytime soon."
