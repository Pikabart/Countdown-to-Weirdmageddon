    MEX_START.1.t:0 "Prosperity just South of the Border"
    MEX_START.1.d:0 "Mexico entered the 21st century in a unique position. Thanks to aggressive reform from within and massive aid for the three democratic superpowers, the country stands as strong as it had ever had in its nearly two hundred years of existence. Though a North American nation, its position lets it exert notable influence on its Central American neighbors, thus control of the entire sub-continent. With the withdrawal of US forces after the end of the Cold War from that region, the United States, the European Union, and the Imperial Commonwealth have all made approaches to bring Mexico into its sphere of influence.\n\nThis can only help Mexico in a world where the three superpowers jouster for international influence. The Yankees are its immediate neighbor and major trading partner while being home to the largest Hispanic population outside Latin America. Canada is close by as well as Imperial nations like Jamaica and the Bahamas in the Caribbean, ensuring peace in the oceans. The Franco-Germans are the furthest but have made up the distance in more capital in investment and aid. To bring Mexico into their alliances would bring all of Central America into their sphere as well. So far, Mexico has done better than most expect in using that to its advantage.\n\nNow as a new election nears this summer, most expect the maintenance of the status quo. Some of their best agents serving in the US’s FPI had warned of something unknown approaching and that precaution is needed. But in any event, that’s what the other powers are for, to defend the world. For the Americans to jump in head long, the Europeans to fix what the Americans broke, and the Canadians to make sure the Yanks and Euros don’t accidently, or otherwise, kill each other in the process."

    MEX_DRUMPF.1.t:0 "The Mexican Turbar"
    MEX_DRUMPF.1.d:0 "With Canada gone and the US and EU on the verge of blowing each other up, Mexico had taken a hit to its economy. With trade across the world disrupted by the collapse of the Americans and the Commonwealth, Mexicans worry about what the country must do to protect itself. Besides the new instability it must deal with its central american neighbors, the new neighbors north are of concern. The Eastern US still holds on, with President Curtis being a dictator in all but name. West of the Mississippi, many of the states have declared home rule or even outright independence.\n\nTo the west, California has emerged as a new nation with already twice the economy of Mexico in spite of only a fifth the population. While their Lieutenant Governor Hector Guzman is a close friend of the traditional powers of Mexico, their new governor, Emperor Joshua Norton is an odd anomaly. Some like him, as he holds the, self appointed, title of the 'Protector of Mexico'. Others are bewildered that the Californias would so eagerly embrace him. Still, better than Oregon’s President Trembley. Mexico’s division of the FPI has shown that, before he became president, Trembley fought with the Texas insurgency, having been present at the Alamo. He survived when during the battle, a cannon ball blew him off the wall defences, he fell on a horse that promptly escaped the battle.\n\nSpeaking of Texas, there is Texas. Now independent once more, Mexico have been unable to gauge their new stance of the world. Worst still, some politicians want to use this to their advantage. With the US gone, some claim the time for The Reconquista, where we invade and take back Mexico's lands lost hundreds of years ago. The outgoing president has already declared that as insane and suicidal, citing just California’s military under the famed General Pines as being more than a match for Mexico, let alone whatever the Texans might have. Still, Mexican real estate tycoon and tv actor Dónald Drumpf has championed the new aggressive policy and has come from dead last to front runner for the presidency."

    MEX_DRUMPF.2.t:0 "The Election of 2012"
    MEX_DRUMPF.2.d:0 "The election is upon all of Mexico. A distant relative of California’s Lt. Gov Hector Guzman, Baja California Senator Eduardo Diaz has emerged as the front runner for the Sanity Coalition, a massive coalition of numerous parties trying to defeat Senor Dónald Drumpf of the Mexico Grande Party. While normally when something this close occurs, the US or the EU would do some traditional election interference. But the election has gone unnoticed as they gear up to war over Canada and Norway. Truly, this election would be fair. As it is known, the greatest tragedies to democracy often come from democracy in action."
    MEX_DRUMPF.2.a:0 "La Cordura Prevalece!"
    MEX_DRUMPF.2.b:0 "Haz Que Mexico Vuelva A Ser Grande!"
    
    MEX_DRUMPF.3.t:0 "Sanity Prevails!"
    MEX_DRUMPF.3.d:0 "Senator Eduardo Diaz has won! By the slimmest of margins, the election has gone for sanity and sanity has certainly prevailed. Already, congratulations from around the remaining functional parts of the world are coming in. At home, Emperor Norton, President Trembley, and even the new President of Texas have sent congratulations. Norton has reiterated his assurance to protect Mexico, with Guzman assuring that it's a good thing. Across the seas in Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Britannia and the Commonwealth, Empress of India and Japan, have sent her congratulations. Oddly more, a Princess Star Butterfly, from another dimension that California had been in contact with, had sent a letter of congratulations on behalf of her ‘Kingdom of Mewni’. Truly a victory of interdimensional proportion.\n\nWith the old order prevailing, Mexico stands ready to defend itself and help bring order once Canada returns and the US and EU regain their lost minds. The night is dark, but the dawn shall soon arrive once more.\n\nAlso, the Canadian-In-Exile goverment also sent thier regards. Didn't want to forget them too!"
    MEX_DRUMPF.3.a:0 "Viva La Cordura!"
    
    MEX_DRUMPF.4.t:0 "Make Mexico Great Again"
    MEX_DRUMPF.4.d:0 "To the shock of all, Dónald Drumpf has won the election. The whole world, that hasn't been torn apart by the Canadian Kerfuffle, are horrified that the election has gone that way. Already there are massive protests in the streets across Mexico as many nations and US Nation States have cut ties over the event. In the US, the President of Texas has reiterated Texan independence and swore to all, ‘The Rio Grande and not one inch less’ as new militias are called up. In California, Emperor and Imperial Governor Norton expressed shock by the news. He had given his own speech that he will reinstate his title of ‘the Protector of Mexico’, clarifying the protection of freedom and democracy of the Mexicans will be protected by him, wherever the threat may come from. Many Mexican-Americans in California are already joining up the Imperial Californian Military, calling on Norton to march south. Even what's left of Canada have sent a very mixed message of this outcome.\n\nTo Drumpf and his supporters, their rhetoric has been a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Mexico has lost support and allies in a short period of time due to Drumpf's abrasive and aggressive stance. As Drumpf sat down on his desk in Mexico City, he prepared his own plans for Mexico."

    MEX_DRUMPF.5.t:0 "El Muro de Dónald"
    MEX_DRUMPF.5.d:0 "To aid in the defence of Mexico, President Drupf has ordered the construction of a wall across the old US-Mexican Border. Leaders all across the US have issued complaints and objections to this. Even President Curtis has issued a warning, promising to personally kick his ‘fat, tan butt’ when he is done with the Euros. Many leaders in Mexico have also objected, as the wall worsen ties, disrupts trade and ecological flow, and some comspiracists are even saying that the wall is really meant to keep Mexicans in. Drumpf states it would keep the Americans out, since they are ‘not sending their best’.\n\nIn all this, many have ignored the European’s response. Mexico is still a vital part of their short and long term international goals. As the remaining loyal Eastern US Navy can’t protect all of the Atlantic and the Commonwealth Navies won’t lift a finger without Canada’s orders, the threat of a new Third Franco-German Intervention into Mexico now looms and is being ignored by the one man who should be paying attention to it."
    MEX_DRUMPF.5.a:0 "Just Build My Wall!"
    
    MEX_DRUMPF.6.t:0 "Not Again!"
    MEX_DRUMPF.6.d:0 "To the shock of many, but to no one’s real surprise, the EU successfully landed and conquered Mexico with lightning speed. Using advance portal technology made by the EIO, European Intelligence Office, EU forces captured cities in minutes as hundreds of thousands of troops poured in from Europe before lunch even began. Already, EU Chancellor Karolina Küchler toured Mexico City today as Mexicans looked on in confusion more than anything else. No one knows really where President Drumpf is, but reports are coming in that the elite European EIO have been dispatched to find him.\n\nAs having Mexico under the EU completely flanks the US defenses along the Atlantic, panic has already erupted across the US. Many states are now rejoining the old US and reports are coming in that California, Oregon, and Texas are forming a new alliance just to defend the border. The Third World War has begun."
