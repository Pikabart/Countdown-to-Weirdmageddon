#Legacy of Solaria

mewni_solaria.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Queen Solaria"
mewni_solaria.1.d:0 "Three hundred years ago, a newly crowned Queen Solaria Butterfly rallied the numerous Mewman kingdoms for a grand campaign. Her mission, that she proclaimed to the Butterfly kingdom on the very night of her coronation, was to bring the entire dimension of Menwi under the rule of Mewmankind. She rallied her armies, perfected the great magic of the Butterfly Line, and began a long and glorious war to crush the monster filth.\n\nShe undoubtedly succeeded, and brought about an unprecedented golden age of Mewman supremacy. Her leadership drove the monster hordes into the Underworld and the Forest of Certain Death, where they still remain fighting amongst themselves. Thanks to her keen interest in alliance building, spearheaded by her older brother, Prince Jushtin Butterfly, she gave birth to the system that stands today as the Kingdom of Mewni. And it would be her dying wish that ensured that through centuries of dynasties and political changes, the Butterfly Family would have everlasting hegemonoy over all of Mewni."

mewni_300_peace.1.d:0 "Mewni has enjoyed three hundred years of peace. There is no doubt of what was accomplished during that time. But it was not an era of "happily ever after." The whole dimension is entering a new era, political alliances are now being tested and strained. The old social order facing challenges from rapidly evolving foes. The economy has stagnated due to minimal reform, the entire economy relying on exporting the corn crop. Even the monsters, who were so utterly crushed three centuries ago, are now starting to recover.\n\n And there is of course, the odd radical and revolutionary here and there. Spewing foreign doctrines of "Freedom" and "Democracy." But they are few and far between."

butterfly_family.1.d:0 "The Butterfly family has ruled most of Mewni since the great Queen Solaria led the glorious fight against the monsters and secured Mewnipendance. Having secured the Mewman’s goal of "Life, Safety, and Corn" the monarchy under House Butterfly has led their kingdom, and by extension most of the Mewman race, through the golden age of Mewman peace. But not all is easy, as in the recent years the reluctance to reform has begun to show it's concequences.\n\nThe Queen Comet Crisis, which had the current Queen Butterfly rise to the throne after her mother was slain by the Monster Toffee, almost had Mewni be plunged into war once again. However, Queen Moon protected her people and prevented the crisis from starting total war. And as a new era dawns on the Mewman dimension, everyone looks to Moon and the Butterfly family for guidance."

MEW_prolouge_end.1.d:0 "Princess Star of House Butterfly, heir to the Mewman throne, is not in her home dimension of Mewni. Instead, she is on Earth. In California, to be precise. This is because she had insufficiently studied her magic, and now with the Butterfly wand in her possession (Given to all Butterfly heirs at age 14,) Her ineptitude is now destructive. The last straw was the great fire of Mewni, which was caused by her the very first day she got her wand. Thus, she will study on earth using their “Foriegn Exchange Program.” Until she can sufficiently control her magic.\n\nIt’s not all bad with her though. Politically speaking, anyway. It seems that every heir in the various Kingdoms that make up the Kingdom of Mewni are of similar age. Thus, all rulers of Mewni could be friends from childhood in the next generation. And there is of course always the possibility of an alliance through marriage."

It was the middle of the night, the shipment from the Earth dimension was due to arrive and Her Highness Queen Moon did not want the public to be openly aware of the shipment. Through the fog, the human vessel arrived. Expecting a slow wooden craft, they were greeted by a monster size ship of metal, coated black as the night and moving against the wind at fast speeds as though it wasn’t there. Stabby himself pulled out his telescope and looked to the flag at the bow of the behemoth. A white background flag with a red star and a red stripe at the bottom. Center was a bear wearing a beaver top hat. Beneath it in Terran English and coincidently Low Mewni were the words, ‘Imperial California Republic’.\n\n‘That’s the ship. A ‘gift’ from their Emperor Norton,’ Stabby remarked.\n\nHis squire, Higgs, was awe struck. ‘How did they fit this ship through a dimension tear?’ she asked.\n\nThe human representative with them smiled and answered, “We have our ways. What you call magic, we call science!’\n\nIt docked at Port Festiva’s largest mooring. As offboarding proceeded, the mewni dockmaster stood in awe of at the massive ship. The human captain complained, remarking of the ‘tiny docks’ and how they could barley moore 'the smallest cargo ship in the Imperial Merchant Navy’. With a dozen heavy duty carts lined along the docks, all pulled by top breed warnicorns, the ship’s cranes loaded up the new equipment. The new machines would go far to relieve the kingdom’s pains. But the knights seemed skeptical at best.\n\nStill, Mr. Birnbaum assured them of Earth’s aid, ‘Rest assured, Emperor Norton and the Northwest Corporation of California stands ready to help. You but merely need to ask.’\n\n‘We’ll see about that, Earth man,’ said Stabby as he signaled the convoy to move out."

MEW_reform_economy_4.1.d:0 "The commission met, as usual, at the Bureaucracy of Magic. Lekmet, as the chancellor of the commission, began the meeting with a traditional speech, a few ‘baahh’s to fully commemorate the meeting. They then began in earnest.\n\nOne of the main agendas, along with the weakening of magic in the realm as of late, was Queen Moon’s new foreign policy. In the wake of reduced crop yields and widespread theft of the Butterfly Kingdom’s Corn Reserves, Moon has opted to look for foreign assistance. While many different dimensions border with Mewni, only Earth had the raw industrial and technological capability to quickly aid in modernizing Mewni’s food production. Already, Human staple crops such as wheat, rice, and tubers have surpassed current corn yields. And it has been new harvesting and canning machinery that has increased both the yield and shelf life of Mewni’s food reserves.\n\n'And their leader, Norton. I don’t trust him,’ said Rhombus.\n\nWhile the foreign aid was one issue, the more pressing one also was who was providing the aid. From the very first time they laid eyes on him, the MHC had no love for the human’s 'Emperor'. But Moon’s pressing on the issue has fallen flat. The Commission had only assured her that Joshua Norton and the human’s ‘assistance’ cannot be trusted. While Moon has her own doubts about the motives of the humans, outright rejection of aid so freely given to them would easily prove suicidal.\n\nWith Moon still ultimately in her right as Queen to decide, the Commission expected an answer from her on her plans moving forward."

This could not be tolerated, we are in an industrial crisis after all! And so the Royal Guard was sent in to dissapate the riot and send everyone back to work.\n\nHowever, the protesters were steadfast, unwilling to go back to work. They chanted anti-Butterfly slogans and waved their protest signs wildly. One thing led to another, and the guards had no choice but to draw their weapons and spill blood.\n\nThe day ended in 3 deaths, 1 guard and 2 protesters."

"That monkey will pay for it’s treason," He signaled a guard walked to give him a sword. "Now my sweet Moonpie... En Garde!"\n\nHe charged forward, thrusting at her. Moon quickly entered her Mewberty form and flew up to dodge. With all her arms, she charged some weakened energy balls and fired at River, trying to hit just next to him.

She supported him with her numerous hands, getting him on his knees.\n\n"M- Moonpie... i'm fine. My back is hurting is all. I can power through, I'm a Johansen." He loosley took his sword and swung it at her. The blade hit, but with not enough power to count.\n\n"You're an idiot, that's what you are." Moon took him in her arms and started carrying him out of the combat zone. "I think you've had enough sparring for today."\n\n"I don't care about my need for sparring, the whole point of us coming out here was for you! This isin't over until you've had enough, not me!" He reached into the hidden sword holster in his ankle to take out a dagger, but instead he pulled out a partially eaten corn-on-the-cob. "Oh, right, shouldn't have partied that hard a few days ago... No matter! En Garde!" He started swinging the dry piece of corn at her. Moon couldn't help but smile an adoring smile.\n\n"So you're pushing youself so much for me?"\n\n"I'm not pushing myself! But... yes. I'm doing this for you."\n\n"Aw, how sweet." She kissed him on the cheek. "But seriously, you're gonna hurt yourself. Live to fight another day, alright?"\n\n"...Fine, Moonpie."

She made her way to the home of the Avarius family. Once upon a time, the Avarius family were the official Mewman-recognized rulers of the Forest of Certain Death, an ingenious ploy by Queen Crescenta Butterfly to create a monster tolerating state loyal to the Butterflys. Given that the Avariuses were obviously puppets, few monsters sided with them. The resulting Avarius Kingdom only spanned from the Northen tip of the Eastern monster mountain range, to the border of East Ponycorn. However, there was also a zone north of Stalward Valley, that was De Jure the Avarius' but De facto the Butterfly's. That zone is all that remains of the Avarius Kingdom ever since their son Ludo locked them out of their own castle.\n\nStanding at the door, the first greetings between Lord Brudo and Queen Moon was less than ideal.

ludo_confront_1.2.d:0 "As Lekmet helped himself to some of Ludo’s corn stash, he uncovered the magic book. The rest of the commission gathered around as Lekmet placed the book down and opened it, hoping to find Glossaryck. Instead, they found nothing. Literally. Every page was blank, the book was fake. They rushed back to interrogate Ludo more, tearing a portal back to the main chamber. They were greeted by the sight of a soulless Moon laying on the ground, and a voice that was not of Ludo laughing. They saw Ludo holding the wand as it merged and integrated itself into his arm, the half-crystal embedding itself in his hands.\n\n"Ludo?"\n\n"Ludo’s not here right now. But if you like, you can leave a message."\n\nOmnitraxus emerged from the floor, pounding his ghastly fist, "You did not wanna do that little man-" With a quick zap, Omnitraxus was reduced to a mere skull.\n\nGasping at the sight, Hekapoo and Rhombus charged forward to fight.\n\nThe resulting battle ended in a descisive defeat. Rhombulus and Hekapoo were down, their souls having been absorbed. Chancellor Lekmet had drained his own life force in an attempt to revive them. Now, he only had enough energy to drag himself along the ground."

Ludo showed his hand and the missing finger on it.\n\n"Toffee!"\n\nMoon fired off a series of magical blasts at the Toffee possesed Ludo, who quickly deflected them with an energy shield. A blur of blue and green filled the temple as they battled, yet even in full mewberty form, Moon was quickly bested by him. But before he could go for the kill, Moon let out a huge blast, taking out a quarter of the temple in the process.\n\nIn the confusion, Moon gathered the bodies of the commission and opened a portal to retreat.

ludo_confront_2.1.d:0 "Within hours, Moon was making her next move. She brung Star Butterfly back to Mewni, fearful that she could be picked off alone in that dimension. She and her were in a carriage making haste towards the Magic Sactuary, the magical systems there hopefully being able to revive the Magic High Commision.\n\nHowever, their trip was fraught with hazard. Both their Warnicorns and carriage popped out of existence due to the Magic Fritz, and they were even attacked by a swarm of rats. After a long journey carrying the bodies of the Magic High Commision, they arrived.\n\nIt was a beautiful place, a colorful stony construct surrounded by water in the middle of the forest. The inside featured various waterworks, intricate ancient desgins spouting water. They laid the bodies of the MHC in some flower shaped pods, hoping to revive them. But it didn't work. Instead, as Moon turned a valve to pour regenerative water on them, black sludge poured out. The Magic Fritz had corrupted even this.\n\nMoon decided that she and Star must shelter in place until a better oppourtunity arose, and that they would have to subsist on corn snacks from the nearby vending machine. However, Star objected. Citing how she defeated Toffee before. But Moon struck that notion down, citing how Toffee had killed her own mother, Comet Butterfly, and that her wand was at half power.\n\nBut talking about the past remined Moon of something. Many years ago, she made a deal during the Queen Comet Crisis. What she got out of this deal was the knowledge of a spell which could kill an immortal being. She didn't need to use it back then, but perhaps she would need it now."

ludo_confront_3.1.d:0 "River's regency was... unique, to say the least. King River, who was ruling the Butterfly Kingdom in lieu of his absent wife, threw a lavish party lasting from sunrise to sunset. He had expected his wife to return by evening, but as he woke up the day after she was nowhere to be seen. And so, logically, he put on the music and tried to party yet again. He failed, his people too tired from the night before.\n\nThen an interdimensional portal appeared, and out came a boy. King River remembered him, Marco, an aquaintance of Star when she lived on earth. He asked him where Star was, as apparently she had left earth in a hurry. River had no idea where she or his own wife were, or even when they were gonna return. Marco was alarmed by this, and asked to stay by River's side for the day. He agreed, and let him follow him around.\n\nThe boy was surprisingly helpful, his new perspective making River realize the kingdom was suffering from multiple problems that have poppped up while he was partying. Of these are garbage piling up, multiple buildings on fire, and a giant monster in the cornfields. River decided to deal with the Monster first, rallying the people with a rousing speech of "The Ordinary doing the Extraordinary!" and how "You don't need magic to do magical things!"\n\nWith a large inspired mob brandishing torches and pitchforks, they sallied forth. Due to the operation's disorganized nature, they had to leave the gates open for any peasant who was running late. However, once they reached the monster, a quick communication cleared things up. Apparently, when people were waving the monster to go away, the monster mininterpreted it as a signal to come closer. The Monster went away soon after.\n\nWith that quickly sorted, King River announced "Total Victory." But in the chaotic victorious uproar, they failed to realize something. They forgot to close the door."

He got himself a crown, began the process of discarding all Butterfly Family memorabilia, and has even started his own royal merch line as propaganda.\n\nHe also indulged in the privileges of being King, having the formerly Butterfly employed jesters entertain him while laying in the best bed in the entire dimension. Ludo wasn't stupid, however, and knew the people fostered hatred for him. He knew a coup attempt would come, he just didn't know when.\n\nAs it turns out, pretty soon. A month or so after he took power, while he was touring a Mewman park as a publicity stunt, Moon and Star Butterfly confronted him.\n\nThere was no notion of negotiation in the air as a silent stand off ensued. That ended when Toffee took control of Ludo's body yet again, and striked first. An intense battle ensued, with Moon Butterfly in full Mewberty form and Star Butterfly wielding the royal wand at half strength. The battle lasted hours, but the Butterflys were eventually pushed east into the waters surrounding Butterfly city. With no other option, they fled that same direction."

After Moon and Star got their vitals checked, the first order of business was for Moon to address the people through a universal signal.\n\nMoon sat at a desk infront of a camera, her bandaged hands clearly being shown at the bottom of the screen. "Hello, Mewmans. Now, I know many of you are confused about the ongoings in the Kingdom. The coup, Ludo, whether or not your insurance is viable, some are even making up conspiracy theories about about my trip a few days prior to the coup. That is why I am here to give you the true story. The truth is that, somehow, Ludo got his hands on half of the Butterfly family shard. When I and the Magic High Commision found this out, we went on a mission to stop Ludo before he could use his powers. I... I was the only survivor of that fight."\n\n"And now, we're here. A tyrant warlord sitting on the throne. He is sure to raise a fighting horde in order to defend his illegitimate reigime. That is why I, as your Queen, am asking you to take up arms and fight."\n\n"I am currently based in the Port Festivia Garrison Building. I- no, we, are using every waking moment as preparation to take back the throne. If you wish to come fight for us, for Mewni, for the future of the entire dimension, come here.

Given the current situation in Mewni, the newly declared Imperial California Republic under their Emperor Norton wishes to assist in maintaining stability in the kingdom. Specificly outlined, they wish we transfer control of a stript of land bordering Lake Mewni to them. It's purpose would be to construct a base to manage human forces in Mewni and to protect our southwestern border from the recent collapse of the Musty Kingdom. It would officially be temporarily, but realisiticly they shall hold on to the land for the foreseeable future. In return, the humans will offer major assisatnce in our manufactoring capability and will also send aid in fuel and food, which we could make good use of.\n\nMany in the court are hesitant, however. The land they wish to occupy is known as Solaria's Folly, where the great Queen Solaria was ambushed and slained. The site has some significants to the hardliners in the court and transfering contorl to the land, let alone letting it be turned into a base by foreigners is not popular. But apperently this was intentional and Norton himself insist on the site. He even claimed it's what Solaria herself would have wanted. This has angered the court all around, but the humans will not budge on this. Of course, Queen Moon shall make the final decision.\n\n'The deal is certainly sweet, but the aftertaste won't be liked by many...'"
