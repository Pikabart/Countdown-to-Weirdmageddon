#1.	Create (Or Add) an event file in events for. Be sure to name it by country tag, place in newsevent for world events. Follow other event files to make event itself

#2.	For localization of say ex:mystery_shack.1.t, create or ad into a loc file in localisation folder. File name should be events_*tag*_l_english.yml for locs of said country in english

#3.	In gfx, to add a custom image for event, go to either event_country_pictures or event_news_pictures, which ever is appropriate. 
3A. event_country_pictures - Add por create folder of country for event and add image there with appropriate naming
3B. event_news_pictures - place world news image direct in folder with appropriate name. See others for how name template works

#4.	Go to interface folder if non-stock image is made. To ensure that the game knows that say ex:GFX_report_event_dippy_zog points to the image of dippy zog in gfx, an interface file is needed. Add to or create one with name structure events_*tag*_interface.gfx or add to world one ex:events_news_interface. Check existing files how this works
